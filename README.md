INTRODUCTION
- Efficient water resource utilization is crucial in modern agriculture.
- Suboptimal watering practices can lead to water waste, environmental issues, and reduced crop yields.
- Our project addresses this challenge through the design and development of a smart plant watering system.
COMPONENTS
Components: Arduino Uno microcontroller, soil moisture sensor, water pump, relay channel, transistor, and LEDs.
- Functionality: Continuous monitoring of soil moisture levels, activation of water pump when moisture falls below threshold, LED indicator for system status.
